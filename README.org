* My GNU/Emacs configuration folder

** General Structure

As of 2017-05, I moved my Emacs configuration format from [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Orgstruct-mode.html][OrgStruct
mode]] to Org-mode babel + tangle. Originally, I found this process on
http://www.holgerschurig.de/en/emacs-init-tangle/ However, I adapted
its code and write additional features. I also simplified the file
structure, threw away old stuff and added tons of comments for my
configuration.

Now, my Emacs configuration is in a file named =config.org=. My
=init.el= got some nifty Elisp code that converts/tangles (only) the
Elisp blocks into the =config.el=. This generated file is interpreted
by my GNU/Emacs on startup.

Please do read [[http://karl-voit.at/2017/06/03/emacs-org][my blog article on how this Emacs configuration works]].

** Stuff Which Is Not Contained in the Git Repository

Please take a look at my ~.gitignore~ file that contains some things I
did *not* add to this git repository for a variety of reasons but are
necessary for my configuration. Most important here is the directory
~contrib~ which holds a number of external packages:

- Currently (2017-05-26), this directory holds:
  - cygwin-mount.el
  - ews-orgmode/
  - goto-chg.el
  - message-outlook.el
  - move-text/
  - ob-restclient.el/
  - orgaggregate/
  - org.el
  - [[https://raw.github.com/vjohansen/emacs-config/master/org-import-calendar.el][org-import-calendar.el]]
  - [[http://Orgmode.org][org-mode]]/
  - org-protocol-capture-html/
  - outlookedit.el
  - outshine/
  - pdf-mode/
  - [[http://taesoo.org/proj/pylookup.html][pylookup]]/
  - raml-mode/
  - setup-cygwin.el
  - sunrise-commander/
  - vcard-mode/
  - [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/wc.el][wc.el]]

** In Case You Want to Use My Configuration

In short: don't.

Not because I don't like you to have my configuration. It is not easy
to accomplish because I left out some parts like the ~contrib~
directory as explained above. Some of my settings are host-specific
and/or depend on path variables or external tools.

You should only adopt Elisp code you need and understand to avoid
[[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DotEmacsBankruptcy][Emacs Bankruptcy]].

Therefore: please feel free to look up certain tricks and functions
and add it to your configuration. But don't use my repository as is
and expect it to run on your host.

** Best Navigation Experience

For navigating through my =config.org= file, please do open it in
Emacs so that you are able to collapse and expand headings.

** Host-Names

Some settings as specific for certain platforms or host names. The
host names mentioned here are:

- sherri
  - Debian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie)
  - my main working horse at home

- X260
  - Debian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie)
  - my main working horse on the road

- grmlvrs/kva
  - Debian GNU/Linux 7 (wheezy)
    - (therefore) not as "capable" as sherri/X260

- atgrz*
  - Windows 7 Pro with native Windows GNU/Emacs 64bit and [[http://babun.github.io/][Babun]]
    - (therefore) not as "capable" as gary

- outdated:
  - gary
    - Debian GNU/Linux 7 (wheezy)
    - predecessor of X260
  - blanche
    - OS X 10.5
    - pimped with [[https://www.macports.org/][MacPorts]]
    - predecessor of sherri

With 2016-04, I switched from using ~my-system-is-HOSTNAME~ to
~my-system-type-is-OPERATINGSYSTEM~ instead for most cases. This
lowers the effort of using Emacs on many computers.

** Emacs 24

As with 2014-01-19, I totally migrated to GNU/Emacs 24 on all of my
systems.

I therefore migrated my config to use the package management provided
by Emacs 24. As a result, there are much less entries in the folder
"contrib" and there is a new folder called "elpa". I did not include
elpa-packages in this git repository.

On 2016-04-24, I had following packages installed via elpa:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports results :results output
ls -1 $HOME/.emacs.d/elpa | egrep -v '(archives|gnupg|.txt)'
#+END_SRC

I also tested [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][Emacs prelude]] for a couple of days. However, I was not
very happy about it due to performance issues, unwanted behavior, and
the feeling of losing control.

Please note that ~org-30000101~ is a [[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/104548/][manually created and installed
pseudo-package]] to prevent the installation of Org-mode via package
manager. I am using the Org Maint version from git directly (within my
~contrib~ directory).

** Useful References

- http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryDotEmacs
- http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LoadPath
  - ~$HOME/.emacs.d/lisp/~ seems to be quite common as directory path for
    installing external packages
  - However, I do prefer "contrib" instead of "lisp" because:
    - my own config (outside of ~$HOME/.emacs.d/lisp/~) is LISP as well
    - "lisp" does not contain the notion of "contributed from other
      people/projects"
